This config is a modified copy of LaunchVim. Please frist look into said config.

## Install Neovim 0.9

You can install Neovim with your package manager e.g. brew, apt, pacman etc.. bus remember that when you update your packages Neovim may be upgraded to a newer version.

## Get healthy

Open `nvim` and enter the following:

```
:checkhealth
```


- On Ubuntu

  ```sh
  sudo apt install xsel # for X11
  sudo apt install wl-clipboard # for wayland
  ```

we will also need `ripgrep` for Telescope to work:

- Ripgrep

  ```sh
  sudo apt install ripgrep
  ```

## Fonts

I recommend using the following repo to get a "Nerd Font" (Font that supports icons)
